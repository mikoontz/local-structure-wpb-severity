\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Bark beetles are a primary mortality agent of trees in western U.S.
forests, and the recent Californian hot drought of 2012 to 2015 created
favorable conditions for bark beetle-induced tree mortality throughout
the yellow pine/mixed-conifer forest system in the Sierra Nevada
mountain range. The western pine beetle, \emph{Dendroctonus brevicomis},
is the forest insect that is largely responsible for the especially
common deaths of its main host in California, the ponderosa pine tree
(\emph{Pinus ponderosa}). While previous work has demonstrated a link
between climate conditions related to tree water stress and forest
density on the severity of the western pine beetle disturbance, it
remains challenging to disentangle the relative effects of these
variables. Further, forest density can affect western pine beetle
behavior in a number of ways, which creates a need for more information
on complex forest structure (including local density, tree size, and the
heterogeneity of these variables across a forest stand) to uncover the
most likely mechanism.

We conducted aerial surveys over an established network of 32 permanent
vegetation monitoring plots along a 350km and 1000m elevation gradient
in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California using a small,
unhumanned aerial system (sUAS aka drone) equipped with a narrow-band
multispectral camera. Using Structure from Motion (SfM) processing on
over 450,000 images, we reconstructed the complex vegetation structure
of over 9 square kilometers of forest that experienced ponderosa pine
mortality as a result of western pine beetle activity. Using this
dataset, we built a model to predict the probability of ponderosa pine
mortality as a function of forest structure variables (including
ponderosa pine density and mean size, as well as all tree density and
mean size), an environmental gradient of climatic water deficit, and a
Gaussian process to capture spatial covariance in the response. We found
that host tree

Data from small, unhummaned aerial systems (sUAS) can provide important
context surrounding ground plots, which enables inference and generates
new insights into ecological processes. sUAS are best-suited to
enhancing ground data, which implies that we need not abandon lessons
learned from sound experimental design (i.e., a network of plots along a
gradient is still a powerful way to use sUAS data).

Host availability for aggressive bark beetles appears to have played the
dominant role in increasing the probability of ponderosa pine mortality
in the most hard-hit forest stands during the cumulative mortality event
of 2012 to 2018. Host size played a role in its interaction with
environmental condition-- climatic water deficit-- such that smaller
trees increased the probability of ponderosa mortality at cool/wet
sites, while larger trees increased the probability of ponderosa
mortality at hot/dry sites.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Aggressive bark beetles dealt the final blow to many of the nearly 150
million trees killed in the California drought of 2012 to 2015 and its
aftermath (USDAFS 2019). A harbinger of climate change effects to come,
high temperatures exacerbating the extreme drought led to tree mortality
events of unprecedented size in the driest, densest forests across the
state (Millar and Stephenson 2015, Young et al. 2017). A century of fire
suppression policy has enabled forests to grow into dense stands, which
increases water stress on trees and makes them more vulnerable to bark
beetle attack (Fettig 2012, North et al. 2015).

Forests in California's Sierra Nevada region are characterized by
regular bark beetle disturbances that interact with forest structure.
Bark beetles shape forest structure as they sporadically kill weakened
trees under normal conditions, or wide swaths of even healthy trees
under outbreak conditions (Raffa et al. 2015). Forest structure also
strongly influences bark beetle activity. Low-density forests are less
prone to bark beetle attacks (Fettig 2012), but resolving the mechanism
underlying this observation requires a more nuanced view of forest
structure. For instance, a low-density forest may resist attack because
longer dispersal distances are required for successful colonization of
new hosts, because widely-spaced trees experience less competition for
water resources and thus average tree vigor is greater (Hayes et al.
2009), or because its wider canopy openings disrupt pheromone signaling
between beetles (Fettig 2012).

Density is often a coarse gauge of the size and spatial distribution of
trees-- the forest structure-- with which bark beetles interact (Raffa
et al. 2008). Climate change mitigation strategies emphasize reducing
tree densities (North et al. 2015, Young et al. 2017), but understanding
the optimal scale and pattern of tree distribution that can mitigate
bark beetle outbreaks will be vital for predicting how California
forests may respond to these interventions. Recent research has shown a
strong link between complex forest structure and forest resilience, but
measuring this complexity generally requires expensive equipment or
labor-intensive field surveys (Larson and Churchill 2012, Kane et al.
2014). These barriers restrict survey frequency and extent, which limits
insights into phenomena like bark beetle outbreaks that rapidly emerge
over weeks to months but have long-lasting effects on forest conditions.
Further, the vast spatial extent and environmental gradient of mortality
(Young et al. 2017, USDAFS 2019) challenges our ability to
simultaneously consider how environmental conditions may interact with
local forest structure to produce patterns of insect activity. Small,
unhumanned aerial systems (sUAS) enable fast and relatively cheap remote
imaging over dozens of hectares of forest, which can be used to
determine both forest structure and tree condition at the individual
tree scale (Morris et al. 2017, Shiklomanov et al. 2019).

We used ultra-high resolution remote sensing data from a small,
unhumanned aerial system over a network of 32 sites in the Sierra Nevada
spanning 1000m of elevation and 350km of latitude and covering a total
of 9 square kilometers of forest to ask how fine-scale forest structure
affected the probability of tree mortality during the cumulative
mortality event of 2012 to 2018. We asked:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  How does local host tree density and size affect the severity of
  western pine beetle disturbance?
\item
  How does total tree density and size affect the severity of western
  pine beetle disturbance?
\item
  How does environmentally-driven tree moisture stress affect the
  severity of western pine beetle disturbance?
\item
  Do the effects of forest structure and environmental condition on
  western pine beetle disturbance interact?
\end{enumerate}

Which trees die during drought? Gradient of stress to host selection.
Stephenson et al. (2019) argue that there are differences across species
during an extreme drought on whether environment or forest structure
drives mortality. But even within the same species, there could be
\emph{interaction} between the background environmental condition and
the forest struture in driving mortality that gives rise to
stress-dominated mortality in some locations and host-selection
dominated mortality in other locations \emph{for the same species}.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Study system}\label{study-system}

The study sites comprise mostly ponderosa pine trees, \emph{Pinus
ponderosa}, whose primary bark beetle predator in California is the
western pine beetle (WPB), \emph{Dendroctonus brevicomis}. The WPB is an
aggressive bark beetle, meaning it must attack and kill live trees in
order to successfully reproduce (Raffa et al. 2008). Pioneer WPBs
disperse to a new host tree, determine the host's susceptibility to
attack, and use pheromone signals to attract other WPBs. The attracted
WPBs mass attack the tree by boring into its inner bark, laying eggs,
and dying, leaving their offspring to develop inside the doomed tree
before themselves dispersing (Raffa et al. 2008). Small WPB populations
prefer weakened trees but large populations can overwhelm the defense
mechanisms of even healthy trees. Successful attacks on large, healthy
trees are boons to bark beetle fecundity and trigger outbreaks in which
populations explode and massive tree mortality occurs. In California,
the WPB can have 3 generations in a single year giving it a greater
potential to spread rapidly through forests than its more infamous
congener, the mountain pine beetle, \emph{Dendroctonus ponderosa} (MPB).

We built our study on 180 vegetation monitoring plots at 36 sites
established between 2016 and 2017 (Fettig et al. 2019). These
established plots are located in beetle-attacked, mixed-conifer forests
across the Eldorado, Stanislaus, Sierra and Sequoia National Forests
across an elevation gradient (3000-4000 feet, 4000-5000 feet, and 5000+
feet above sea level) and have variable forest structure and disturbance
history. Plot locations were selected specifically in areas with
\textgreater{}40\% ponderosa pine basal area and \textgreater{}10\%
ponderosa pine mortality. The 0.04ha circular plots are clustered along
transects in groups of 5, with between 80 and 200m between each plot.
All trees within the plot were assessed as dead or alive. The stem
location of all trees was mapped relative to the center of each plot
using azimuth/distance measurements. Tree identity to species and
diameter at breast height (dbh) were recorded if dbh was greater than
6.35cm. During the spring and early summer of 2018, all field plots were
revisited to assess whether dead trees had fallen.

\subsubsection{Instrumentation}\label{instrumentation}

Imagery was captured using a DJI Zenmuse X3 RGB camera (DJI 2015a) and a
Micasense RedEdge3 5-band multispectral camera (Micasense 2015). We
mounted both of these instruments simultaneously on a DJI Matrice 100
aircraft (DJI 2015b) using the DJI 3-axis stabilized gimbal for the
Zenmuse X3 camera and a Micasense angled fixed mount for the RedEdge3
camera. The gimbal and the angled fixed mount ensured both instruments
were nadir-facing during image capture. Just prior or after image
capture at each site, we calibrated the RedEdge3 camera by taking an
image of a calibration panel on the ground in full sun with known
reflectance values for each of the 5 narrow bands.

\subsubsection{Flight protocol}\label{flight-protocol}

Image capture was conducted as close to solar noon as possible to
minimize shadow effects (always within 4 hours; usually within 2 hours).
Prior to the aerial survey, two strips of bright orange drop cloth
(\textasciitilde{}100cm x 15cm) were positioned as an ``X'' over the
permanent monuments marking the center of the 5 field plots from Fettig
et al. (2019).

For each of the 36 sites (containing 5 plots each), we captured imagery
over the surrounding \textasciitilde{}40 hectares of forested area using
north-south aerial transects. For XXXXX sites, we surveyed less
surrounding area in order to maintain visual and radio communication
with the aircraft during flight (Table XXXXXX; as a supplement, I think;
Columns: Site, forest, elevation, rep, CWD, surveyed area, survey date).

We preprogrammed transect paths using Map Pilot for DJI on iOS
(hereafter Map Pilot) (Easy 2018). All transects tracked the terrain and
their altitude remained approximately constant at 120 meters above
ground level in order to maintain consistent ground sampling distance in
the imagery. Ground level was based on a 1-arc-second digital elevation
model (Farr et al. 2007) and we implemented terrain following using Map
Pilot. For this analysis, we dropped 4 sites whose imagery was of
insufficient quality to process.

Structure from motion (SfM) processing requires highly overlapping
images, especially in densely vegetated areas. We planned transects with
90\% forward overlap and 90\% side overlap at 100 meters below the lens.
Thus, with flights being at 120 meters above ground level, we achieved
slightly higher than 90/90 overlap for objects 20 meters tall or shorter
(91.6/91.6 overlap at the ground). Overlap values were based on focal
length (3.6mm), sensor width (6.2mm), and image dimension (4000x3000
pixels) parameters of the Zenmuse X3 camera. Images were captured at a
constant rate of 1 image every 2 seconds for both cameras. A forward
overlap of 90\% at 100 meters translates to a flight speed of
approximately 6.45 m/s and a side overlap of 90\% at 100 meters
translates to transects approximately 17.2 meters apart. The Rededge
camera has a different focal length (5.4mm), sensor width (4.8mm), and
image dimension (1280x960 pixels), which translates to image overlap of
80.7/80.7 at 100m below the lens and 83.9/83.9 at ground level.
Approximately 1900 photos were captured over each 40 hectare survey area
for each camera.

\subsubsection{Structure from motion/Photogrammetric
processing}\label{structure-from-motionphotogrammetric-processing}

We used structure from motion (SfM), aka photogrammetry, to generate
orthorectified reflectance maps, digital surface models, and dense point
clouds for each field site. We used Pix4Dmapper Cloud to process imagery
using parameters ideal for images of a densely vegetated area taken by a
multispectral camera. For three sites, we processed the RGB and the
multispectral imagery in the same project to enhance the resolution of
the dense point cloud. All SfM projects resulted in a single processing
``block,'' indicating that all images in the project were optimized and
processed together.

\subsubsection{Creating canopy height
models}\label{creating-canopy-height-models}

We classified each survey area's dense point cloud into ``ground'' and
``non-ground'' points using a cloth simulation filter algorithm (Zhang
et al. 2016) implemented in the \texttt{lidR} (Roussel et al. 2019)
package. We rasterized the ground points using the \texttt{raster}
package (Hijmans et al. 2019) to create a digital terrain model
representing the ground underneath the vegetation at 1 meter resolution.
We created a canopy height model by subtracting the digital terrain
model from the digital surface model created in Pix4Dmapper.

\subsubsection{Tree detection}\label{tree-detection}

We tested a total of 7 automatic tree detection algorithms and a total
of 177 parameter sets on the canopy height model or the dense point
cloud to locate trees within each site (Table XXXXX; algorithm, number
of parameter sets, reference). We used 3 parameter sets of a variable
window filter implmented in \texttt{ForestTools} (Plowright 2018)
including the default variable window filter function in
\texttt{ForestTools} as well as the ``pines'' and ``combined'' functions
from Popescu and Wynne (2004). We used 6 parameter sets of a local
maximum filter implemented in \texttt{lidR}. We used 131 parameter sets
of the algorithm from Li et al. (2012), which operates on the original
point cloud. These parameter sets included those from Shin et al. (2018)
and Jakubowski et al. (2013). We used 3 parameter sets of the
\texttt{watershed} algorithm implemented in \texttt{lidR}, which is a
wrapper for a function in the \texttt{EBImage} package (Pau et al.
2010). We used 3 parameter sets of \texttt{ptrees} (Vega et al. 2014)
implemented in \texttt{lidR} (Roussel et al. 2019) and
\texttt{lidRplugins} (Roussel 2019) and which operates on the raw point
cloud, without first normalizing it to height above ground level (i.e..
subtracting the ground elevation from the dense point cloud). We used
the default parameter set of the \texttt{multichm} (Eysn et al. 2015)
algorithm implmented in \texttt{lidR} (Roussel et al. 2019) and
\texttt{lidRplugins} (Roussel 2019). We used 30 parameter sets of the
experimental algorithm \texttt{lmfx} (Roussel 2019).

\subsubsection{Map ground data}\label{map-ground-data}

Each orthorectified reflectance map was inspected to locate the 5 orange
``X''s marking the center of the field plots. We were able to locate 110
out of 180 field plots and were then able to use these plots for
validation of automated tree detection algorithms. We used the
\texttt{sf} package (Pebesma et al. 2019) to convert
distance-from-center and azimuth measurements of each tree in the ground
plots to an x-y position on the SfM-derived reflectance map using the
x-y position of the orange X visible in the reflectance map as the
center.

\subsubsection{Correspondence of automatic tree detection with ground
data}\label{correspondence-of-automatic-tree-detection-with-ground-data}

We calculated 7 forest structure metrics for each field plot using the
ground data collected by Fettig et al. (2019): total number of trees,
number of trees greater than 15 meters, number of trees less than 15
meters, mean height of trees, 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile tree
height, 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile tree height, mean distance to
nearest tree neighbor, mean distance to 2\textsuperscript{nd} nearest
neighbor.

For each tree detection algorithm and parameter set described above, we
calculated the same set of 7 structure metrics within the footprint of
the validation field plots. We calculated the Pearson's correlation and
root mean square error (RMSE) between the ground data and the aerial
data for each of the 7 structure metrics for each of the 177 automatic
tree detection algorithms/parameter sets.

For each algorithm and parameter set, we calculated its performance
relative to other algorithms as whether its Pearson's correlation was
within 5\% of the highest Pearson's correlation as well as whether its
RMSE was within 5\% of the lowest RMSE. For each algorithm/parameter
set, we summed the number of forest structure metrics for which it
reached these 5\% thresholds. For automatically detecting trees across
the whole study, we selected the algorithm/parameter set that performed
well across the most number of forest metrics.

\subsubsection{Segmentation of crowns}\label{segmentation-of-crowns}

We delineated individual tree crowns with a marker controlled watershed
segmentation algorithm (Meyer and Beucher 1990) using the detected
treetops as markers implemented in the \texttt{ForestTools} package
(Plowright 2018). If the automatic segmentation algorithm failed to
generate a crown segment for a detected tree (e.g., often snags with a
very small crown footprint), a circular crown was generated with a
radius of 0.5 meters. If the segmentation generated multiple polygons
for a single detected tree, only the polygon containing the detected
tree was retained. Image overlap decreases near the edges of the overall
flight path, which reduces the quality of the SfM processing in those
areas. Thus, we excluded segmented crowns within 35 meters of the edge
of the survey area.

We used the \texttt{velox} package (Hunziker 2017) to extract all the
pixel values from the orthorectified reflectance map for each of the 5
narrow bands within each segmented crown polygon. Per pixel, we
additionally calculated the normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI; Rouse et al. (1973)), the normalized difference red edge (NDRE;
Gitelson and Merzlyak (1994)), the red-green index (RGI; Coops et al.
(2006)), the red edge chlorophyll index (CI{[}red edge{]}; Clevers and
Gitelson (2013)), and the green chlorophyll index (CI{[}green{]};
Clevers and Gitelson (2013)). For each crown polygon, we calculated the
mean value for each raw and derived reflectance band (5 raw; 5 derived).

\subsubsection{Classification of trees}\label{classification-of-trees}

We overlaid the segmented crowns on the reflectance maps from 20 sites
spanning the latitudinal and elevational gradient in the study. Using
QGIS, we hand classified XXXX trees as live/dead and as one of 5
dominant species in the study area (\emph{Pinus ponderosa}, \emph{Pinus
lambertiana}, \emph{Abies concolor}, \emph{Calocedrus decurrens}, or
\emph{Quercus kelloggi}) using the mapped ground data as a guide.

We used all 10 mean values of the reflectance bands for each tree crown
polygon to predict whether the hand classified trees were alive or dead
using a boosted logistic regression model implemented in the
\texttt{caret} package (Kuhn 2008). For just the living trees, we
similarly used all 10 reflectance values to predict the tree species
using regularized discriminant analysis implemented in the
\texttt{caret} package, which proved to have the highest accuracy for a
training dataset (accuracy = XXXXX, kappa = XXXXX).

Finally, we used these models to classify all tree crowns in the data
set as alive or dead as well as the species of living trees.

\subsubsection{Allometric scaling of height to basal
area}\label{allometric-scaling-of-height-to-basal-area}

We converted the height of each tree determined using the canopy height
model to its basal area. Using the tree height and diameter at breast
height (DBH; breast height = 1.37m) ground data from Fettig et al.
(2019), we fit a simple linear regression to predict DBH from height for
each of the 5 dominant species. Using the model-classified tree species
of each segmented tree, we used the corresponding linear relationship
for that species to estimate the DBH given the tree's height. We then
calculated each tree's basal area, assuming no tapering from breast
height.

\subsubsection{Note on assumptions about dead
trees}\label{note-on-assumptions-about-dead-trees}

For the purposes of this study, we assumed that all dead trees were
ponderosa pine and were thus host trees. This is a reasonably good
assumption, given that Fettig et al. (2019) found that 73.4\% of the
dead trees in the coincident ground plots were ponderosa pine.

\subsubsection{Rasterizing individual tree
data}\label{rasterizing-individual-tree-data}

Because the tree detection algorithms were validated against ground data
at the plot level, we rasterized the classified trees at a spatial
resolution similar to that of the ground plots (rasterized to 20m x 20m
equalling 400 m\textsuperscript{2}; circular ground plots with 11.35m
radius equalling 404 m\textsuperscript{2}). In each raster cell, we
tallied: number of alive trees, number of dead trees, number of
ponderosa pine trees, number of non-ponderosa pine trees, basal area of
ponderosa pine trees, basal area of non-ponderosa pine trees.

\subsubsection{Environmental data}\label{environmental-data}

We used climatic water deficit (CWD) (Stephenson 1998) from the
1980-2010 mean value of the basin characterization model (Flint et al.
2013) as an integrated measure of temperature and moisture conditions
for each cell. Higher values of CWD correspond to hotter, drier
conditions and lower values correspond to cooler, wetter conditions CWD
has been shown to correlate well with broad patterns of tree mortality
in the Sierra Nevada (Young et al. 2017). We resampled the climatic
water deficit product using bilinear interpolation implemented in the
\texttt{raster} package to match the 20m x 20m spatial scale of the
other variables. We converted the CWD value for each cell into a z-score
representing that cell's deviation from the mean CWD across the climatic
range of Sierra Nevada ponderosa pine as determined from XXXXX herbarium
records described in Baldwin et al. (2017). Thus, a CWD z-score of one
would indicate that the CWD at that cell is one standard deviation
hotter/drier than the mean CWD across all geolocated herbarium records
for ponderosa pine in the Sierra Nevada.

\subsubsection{Statistical model}\label{statistical-model}

We used a generalized linear model with a zero-inflated binomial
response and a logit link to predict the probability of ponderosa pine
mortality within each raster cell as a function of the crossed effects
of ponderosa pine quadratic mean diameter and density added to the
crossed effect of overall quadratic mean diameter and density as well as
the interaction of each summand with climatic water deficit at each
site.

To measure and account for spatial autocorrelation of the bark beetle
behavioral processes underlying ponderosa mortality, we first subsampled
the data at each site to a random selection of 200, 20m x 20m cells
representing approximately 27.5\% of the surveyed area. With these
subsampled data, we included a separate exact Gaussian process term per
site of the interaction between the x- and y-position of each cell using
the \texttt{gp()} function in the \texttt{brms} package (Bürkner 2017).
The Gaussian process accounts for spatial autocorrelation in the model
by jointly estimating the spatial covariance of the response variable
with the effects of the other covariates.

Where \(y_i\) is the number of dead trees in cell \(i\), \(n_i\) is the
sum of the dead trees and live ponderosa pine trees in cell \(i\),
\(\pi_i\) is the probability of ponderosa pine tree mortality in cell

\(X_{pipoDensity, i}\) is the scaled density of ponderosa pine trees in

We used 4 chains with 2000 iterations each (1000 warmup, 1000 samples),
and confirmed chain convergence by ensuring all \texttt{Rhat} values
were less than 1.1 (Brooks and Gelman 1998). We used posterior
predictive checks to visually confirm model performance by overlaying
the density curves of the predicted number of dead trees per cell over
the observed number (Gabry et al. 2019). For the posterior predictive
checks, we used 50 random samples from the model fit to generate 50
density curves and ensured curves were centered on the observed
distribution, paying special attention to model performance at capturing
counts of zero.

\subsubsection{Software and data
availability}\label{software-and-data-availability}

All data are available via the Open Science Framework. Statistical
analyses were performed using the \texttt{brms} packages. With the
exception of the SfM software (Pix4Dmapper Cloud) and the GIS software
QGIS, all data carpentry and analyses were performed using \texttt{R} (R
Core Team 2018).

\subsubsection{Effect of local structure and regional climate on western
pine beetle
severity}\label{effect-of-local-structure-and-regional-climate-on-western-pine-beetle-severity}

We detected no main effect of climatic water deficit on the probability
of ponderosa pine mortality within each 20m x 20m cell.

We found a strong main effect of ponderosa pine local density,
accounting for quadratic mean diameter of ponderosa pine, with greater
density increasing the probability of ponderosa pine mortality.
Conversely, we found a generally negative effect of quadratic mean
diameter of ponderosa pine on the probability of ponderosa mortality,
suggesting that the western pine beetle attacked smaller trees, on
average. There was a strong positive interaction between the climatic
water deficit and ponderosa pine quadratic mean diameter, such that
larger trees were more likely to increase the probability of ponderosa
mortality in hotter, drier sites.

We found negative main effects of overall tree density and overall
quadratic mean diameter. There was a positive interaction between these
variables, such that denser stands with larger trees did lead to greater
ponderosa pine mortality.

\subsubsection{Spatial effects}\label{spatial-effects}

We were able to calculate the length scale of the spatial
autocorrelation in the probability of ponderosa pine mortality at each
site, accounting for forest structure and environmental factors. By
fitting a separate approximate Gaussian process for each site on the
interacting variables of the x- and y- position, we measured the spatial
covariance inherent in the data, accounting for other factors. \#\#
Discussion

\subsubsection{Closer spacing between potential host trees facilitates
dispersal}\label{closer-spacing-between-potential-host-trees-facilitates-dispersal}

If this drives mortality patterns, then we'd expect the local density of
ponderosa pine trees, accounting for other variables, to have a strong
positive effect.

\subsubsection{Host preference for large
trees}\label{host-preference-for-large-trees}

If this drives mortality patterns, then we'd expect the quadratic mean
diameter of ponderosa pine trees, accounting for other variables, to
have a strong positive effect.

\subsubsection{Denser forests augment pheromone
communication}\label{denser-forests-augment-pheromone-communication}

If this drives mortality patterns, then we'd expect the local density of
all trees, accounting for other variables, to have a strong positive
effect.

\subsubsection{Tree crowding leads to greater average water stress per
tree}\label{tree-crowding-leads-to-greater-average-water-stress-per-tree}

If this drives mortality patterns, then we'd expect the quadratic mean
dimater of all trees, accounting for other factors, to have a strong
positive effect.

\subsubsection{Interaction between host density and host
size}\label{interaction-between-host-density-and-host-size}

A positive coefficient would indicate a combined effect of WPB
preference for large trees and nearby host availability.

\subsubsection{Interaction between all tree density and all tree
size}\label{interaction-between-all-tree-density-and-all-tree-size}

A positive coefficient would indicate a combined effect of tree crowding
and pheromone communication enhancement.

\subsubsection{Implications of forest structure/regional climate
interactions}\label{implications-of-forest-structureregional-climate-interactions}

We found that the probability of ponderosa pine mortality generally
increased with local host availability (host density), but also
interacted with both host size and regional climate such that the role
of tree size became increasingly important in more climatically extreme
sites. A smaller average tree size led to a lower probability of
ponderosa mortality in cool/wet sites and a larger average tree size led
to a greater probability of ponderosa mortality in hot/dry sites. These
mortality patterns highlight a possible distinction in behavior between
the recent western bark beetle activity across the gradient of climatic
water deficit. Even in the most highly impacted forest stands (because
our study sites were selected conditional on there being high levels of
western pine beetle activity), there is still a detectable effect of
tree size such that the smaller (presumably weaker) trees are getting
killed in cooler/wetter sites, and the larger (presumably more
well-defended) trees are getting killed more in the hotter/drier sites.
So while mortality is high everywhere, there does appear to be a
difference in the beetle choosiness across the climatic water deficit
gradient.

\subsubsection{Similarities and differences with Fettig et al.
(2019)}\label{similarities-and-differences-with-fettig2019}

Fettig et al. (2019) found positive relationship between number of trees
killed and: total number of trees, total basal area, stand density
index.

Fettig et al. (2019) found negative relationship between the proportion
of trees killed and: total number of trees, stand density index.

Hayes et al. (2009) and Fettig et al. (2019) found measures of host
availability explained less variation in mortality than measures of
stand density.

Negrón et al. (2009) reported positive association of probability of
ponderosa pine mortality and tree density during a drought in Arizona.

Effect of competition may be masked because drought was so extreme
Fettig et al. (2019); Floyd et al. (2009), which is perhaps why we saw a
counter-intuitive signal of increasing total basal area leading to lower
probability of ponderosa pine mortality.

\subsubsection{Broader context around field
plots}\label{broader-context-around-field-plots}

We surveyed 9 square kilometers of forest representing
\textasciitilde{}450,000 trees along a broad gradient. Site selection
and small plot size can influence inference. For instance, Fettig et al.
(2019) reported statistically undetectable differences in overall
mortality in their plot network across 4 national forests. By expanding
the hectarage surveyed by a factor of 200, we detected dramatic
differences in overall mortality.

This is about more than sample size (though that helps). This is also
about capturing the local disturbance phenomenon.

\subsubsection{Implications for future forest
structure}\label{implications-for-future-forest-structure}

We have demonstrated that forest structure (local host density and size)
affected the cumulative severity of the western pine beetle in the
Sierra Nevada in the 2012 to 2015 drought and its aftermath. Clearly,
this forest insect disturbance has reciprically impacted the forest
structure, with uncertain consequences for long-term forest dynamics.

Small trees are getting killed in cooler/wetter sites, larger trees
getting killed in hotter/drier sites. Perhaps the cooler/wetter sites
are resisting even this massive disturbance event?

\subsubsection{Spatial effect}\label{spatial-effect}

The western pine beetle is known to exhibit strong aggregation and
anti-aggregation behavior arising from its pheromone communication, and
thus it is likely that the measured spatial covariance in this study is
attributable in part to the magnitude of this effect at each site.

Some studies have suggested that ``outbreak'' conditions are
distinguishable by clustered tree mortality, but this is perhaps
challenging to tease apart (Raffa et al. 2008). Our modeling framework
allows for a joint estimation of the effects of forest structure,
environmental condition, and the spatial effect. This framework would be
enhanced with confidence in individual tree level data, and a lot of it,
along with a strong gradient of environmental conditions and forest
structure.

We won't interpret this measure of contagion, because the uncertainties
in this particular study are too great (tree detection, species
classification, dead trees all assumed to be WPB hosts, didn't account
for topographic effects which could also manifest as part of this
spatial covariance process). We do suggest that this could be a
meaningful and quantifiable means of assessing bark beetle ``stage of
outbreak''.

\subsubsection{Future spatial directions (will cut this; here for now so
I can write it down
elsewhere)}\label{future-spatial-directions-will-cut-this-here-for-now-so-i-can-write-it-down-elsewhere}

Perhaps could also compare relative effect of individual tree spacing
(Voronoi polygon area) with the length scale parameter at a certain site
to get at a similar question. A big voronoi polygon area effect and a
short covariance kernel tells us that it's a water stress effect-- a
crowded tree gets attacked regardless of whether nearby trees were
attacked. A small voronoi polygon area effect and a long covariance
kernel tells us that the mortality is patterned more based on there
being spillover from nearby attacked neighbors instead of how crowded
any given tree is. I expect we might see different relative magnitudes
of voronoi polygon area and covariance kerenel effects depending on CWD.

\subsubsection{Important considerations}\label{important-considerations}

Cumulative effect of elevated insect activity, as mortality was spread
out over 5 years and we surveyed at the end. All the detected dead trees
were considered ponderosa pine-- we know this is wrong. Only about 3 out
of 4 dead trees in Fettig et al. (2019) were ponderosa.

\subsubsection{Room for improvement}\label{room-for-improvement}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Better geometry by using higher overlap, more spatially resolved
  images.
\item
  Better image classification and scalability by using instrumentation
  having spectral overlap with more widely deployed instrumentation
  (e.g., Landsat).
\item
  Better tree detection using machine learning approaches
\item
  Our live/dead classifier works pretty well.
\item
  Our species classifier could improve. Perhaps also using machine
  learning approaches.
\end{itemize}
