  The Californian hot drought of 2012 to 2015 created favorable

  the western pine beetle (WPB; \emph{Dendroctonus brevicomis}). Climate
  conditions and forest density may interact to affect tree mortality,
  but density is a coarse gauge of forest structure that can affect WPB
  behavior in a number of ways. Measuring broad-scale climate conditions

  stages of disturbance (from ``endemic'' to ``outbreak'') depending on
  their regional climate. Management interventions that reduce host
  density may decrease the probability of tree mortality attributed to
  western pine beetles in the future, and our results suggest that
  focusing these treatments on areas that are most likely to exceed
  feedback thresholds (i.e., hot/dry sites with many available hosts)
  will have the best chance of increasing tree survivorship,
  specifically of larger trees.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Bark beetles dealt the final blow to many of the nearly 150 million
trees killed in the California hot drought of 2012 to 2015 and its
aftermath (USDAFS 2019). A harbinger of climate change effects to come,
record high temperatures exacerbated the drought (Griffin and
Anchukaitis 2014), which increased water stress on trees (Asner et al.
2016), making them more susceptible to colonization by bark beetles
(Fettig 2012, Kolb et al. 2016). Further, a century of fire suppression
policy has enabled forests to grow into dense stands, which also makes
them more vulnerable to bark beetles (Fettig 2012). This combination of
environmental conditions and forest structural characteristics led to
tree mortality events of unprecedented size in the driest, densest
forests across the state (Young et al. 2017). The mechanisms underlying
the link between tree susceptibility to colonization by insects and hot,
dry conditions are often directly attributed to tree physiology (Bentz
et al. 2010), while the link to forest density is multifaceted (Fettig
2012). Because forest density is a coarse metric of the forest features
to which bark beetles respond (Raffa et al. 2008), our understanding of
the connection between forest density and insect disturbance severity
could be enhanced with more finely-resolved measures of forest structure
as well as explicit consideration of species composition (Stephenson et
al. 2019, Fettig et al. 2019). Finally, the challenge of simultaneously
measuring the effects of both local-scale forest features (such as
structure and composition) and broad-scale environmental conditions on
forest insect disturbance leaves their interaction effect relatively
underexplored (Seidl et al. 2016, Stephenson et al. 2019, Fettig et al.
2019).

The ponderosa pine/mixed-conifer forests in California's Sierra Nevada
region are characterized by regular bark beetle disturbances, primarily
by the influence of western pine beetle (\emph{Dendroctonus brevicomis};
WPB) on its host ponderosa pine (\emph{Pinus ponderosa}) (Fettig 2016).
The WPB is a ``primary'' bark beetle-- its reproductive success is
contingent upon host tree mortality, which itself requires enough
beetles to ``mass attack'' the host tree and overwhelm its defenses
(Raffa and Berryman 1983). This Allee effect creates a strong coupling
between beetle selection behavior of host trees and host tree
susceptibility to colonization (Raffa and Berryman 1983, Logan et al.
1998). A key defense mechanism of trees to bark beetle attack is to
flood beetle bore holes with resin, which physically expels beetles and
may interrupt beetle communication (Franceschi et al. 2005, Raffa et al.
2015). Under normal conditions, weakened trees with compromised defenses
are the most susceptible to colonization and will be the main targets of
primary bark beetles like the western pine beetle (Bentz et al. 2010,
Raffa et al. 2015). Under severe water stress, many trees no longer have
the resources available to mount a defense (Kolb et al. 2016) and thus
prolonged drought can often trigger increased bark beetle-induced tree
mortality as average tree vigor declines (Bentz et al. 2010). As local
population density of beetles increases due to successful reproduction
within spatially-aggregated weakened trees, as might occur during
drought, mass attacks grow in size and become capable of overwhelming
formidable tree defenses such that even healthy trees may be susceptible
to colonization and mortality (Bentz et al. 2010, Raffa et al. 2015).
Thus, water stress can be a key determinant of whether individual trees
are susceptible to bark beetles under many conditions, and this
environmental condition may interact with beetle population dynamics to
drive tree susceptibility under extreme conditions (Bentz et al. 2010,
Stephenson et al. 2019).

Western pine beetle activity is strongly influenced by forest
structure-- the spatial distribution and size of trees-- and tree
species composition. Taking forest structure alone, high-density forests
are more prone to bark beetle-induced tree mortality (Fettig 2012) which
may arise as greater competition for water resources amongst crowded
trees and thus average tree resistance is lower (Hayes et al. 2009), or
because smaller gaps between trees protect pheromone plumes from
dissipation by the wind and thus enhance intraspecific beetle
communication (Thistle et al. 2004). Tree size is another aspect of
forest structure that affects bark beetle host selection behavior with
smaller trees tending to have lower capacity for resisting attack, and
larger trees being a more desirable target on account of their thicker
phloem providing greater nutritional content (Chubaty et al. 2009, Graf
et al. 2012). Taking forest composition alone, WPB activity in the
Sierra Nevada range of California is necessarily tied to the regional
distribution of its exclusive host, ponderosa pine (Fettig 2016).
Colonization by primary bark beetles can also depend on the relative
frequencies of tree species in a more local area, akin to reduced
oligophagous insect herbivory in forests comprising taxonomically
distinct tree species compared to monocultures (Jactel and Brockerhoff
2007). The interaction between forest structure and composition also
drives WPB activity. For instance, high density forests with high host
availability may experience greater beetle-induced tree mortality
because dispersal distances between potential host trees are shorter and
facilitate successful colonization (Miller and Keen 1960, Berryman 1982,
Fettig et al. 2007) or because high host availability reduces the chance
of individual beetles wasting their limited resources flying to and
landing on a non-host tree (Moeck et al. 1981, Evenden et al. 2014).
Stand-scale measures of forest structure and composition thus paint a
fundamentally limited picture of the mechanisms by which these forest
characteristics affect bark beetle disturbance, but finer-grain
information explicitly recognizing tree size, species, and local tree
density should more appropriately capture the ecological processes
underlying insect-induced tree mortality. Additionally, considering the
effects of local forest structure and composition with the effects of
environmental conditions may help refine our understanding of tree
mortality patterns in widespread events such as during the recent
California hot drought.

The vast spatial extent of tree mortality in the 2012 to 2015 California
hot drought challenges our ability to simultaneously consider how
broad-scale environmental conditions may interact with local forest
structure and composition to affect the dynamic between bark beetle
selection and colonization of host trees, and host tree susceptibility
to attack (Anderegg et al. 2015, Stephenson et al. 2019). Measuring
local forest structure generally requires expensive instrumentation
(Kane et al. 2014, Asner et al. 2016) or labor-intensive field surveys
(Larson and Churchill 2012, Stephenson et al. 2019, Fettig et al. 2019),
which constrains survey extent and frequency. Small, unhumanned aerial
systems (sUAS) enable relatively fast and cheap remote imaging over
dozens of hectares of forest, which can be used to measure complex
forest structure at the individual tree scale (Morris et al. 2017,
Shiklomanov et al. 2019). Distributing such surveys across an
environmental gradient can overcome the data acquisition challenge
inherent in investigating phenomena with both a strong local- and a
strong broad-scale component.

We used ultra-high resolution, sUAS-derived remote sensing data over a
network of 32 sites in Sierra Nevada ponderosa pine/mixed-conifer
forests spanning 1000m of elevation and 350km of latitude (see Fettig et
al. (2019)) and covering a total of 9km\textsuperscript{2} to ask how
broad-scale environmental conditions interacted with local, complex
forest structure to affect the probability of tree mortality during the
cumulative tree mortality event of 2012 to 2018. We asked:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  How does host tree density and average host tree size affect
  WPB-induced tree mortality?
\item
  How does the density of all tree species (hereafter ``overall
  density'') and average tree size of all species (hereafter ``overall
  size'') affect WPB-induced tree mortality?
\item
  How does environmentally-driven tree moisture stress affect
  WPB-induced tree mortality?
\item
  Do the effects of forest structure, forest composition, and
  environmental condition interact to influence WPB-induced tree
  mortality?
\end{enumerate}

latitudinal gradient from the Eldorado National Forest in the north to

elevation bands in each forest, with the plots in the Sequoia National
Forest (the southern-most National Forest) occupying elevation bands
305m above the three bands in the other National Forests in order to
capture a similar community composition.}
\end{figure}

We built our study coincident with 160 vegetation/forest insect
monitoring plots at 32 sites established between 2016 and 2017 by Fettig
et al. (2019) (Figure 1). The study sites were chosen to reflect typical
west-side Sierra Nevada yellow pine/mixed-conifer forests and were
dominated by ponderosa pine trees, \emph{Pinus ponderosa} (Fettig et al.
2019). These established plots were located in WPB-attacked, yellow
pine/mixed-conifer forests across the Eldorado, Stanislaus, Sierra and
Sequoia National Forests and were stratified by elevation (914-1219 m
{[}3000-4000 ft{]}, 1219-1524 m {[}4000-5000 ft{]}, 1524-1829 m
{[}5000-6000 ft{]} above sea level). In the Sequoia National Forest, the
southernmost National Forest in our study, plots were stratified with
the lowest elevation band between 1219 and 1524 m (4000-5000 ft) and
extended to an upper elevation band of 1829-2134 m (6000-7000 ft) to
capture a more similar forest community composition as at the more
northern National Forests. The sites have variable forest structure and
plot locations were selected in areas with \textgreater{}35\% ponderosa
pine basal area and \textgreater{}10\% ponderosa pine mortality. At each
site, five 0.041 ha circular plots were installed along transects with
80 to 200m between plots. In the field, Fettig et al. (2019) mapped all
stem locations relative to the center of each plot using
azimuth/distance measurements. Tree identity to species, tree height,
and diameter at breast height (DBH) were recorded if DBH was greater
than 6.35cm. Year of mortality was estimated based on needle color and
retention, if it wasn't directly observed during site visits. A small
section of bark (approximately 625 cm\textsuperscript{2}) on both north
and south aspects was removed from dead trees to deermine if bark beetle
galleries were present. The shape, distribution, and orientation of
galleries are commonly used to distingush among bark beetle species
(Fettig 2016). In some cases, deceased bark beetles were presetn beneath
the bark to supplement identifications based on gallery formation.
During the spring and early summer of 2018, all field plots were
revisited to assess whether dead trees had fallen (Fettig et al. 2019).

In the typical life cycle of western pine beetles, female WPB initiate
host colonization by tunneling through the outer bark and into the
phloem and outer xylem where they rupture resin canals. As a result,
oleoresin exudes and collects on the bark surface, as is commonly
observed with other bark beetle species. During the early stages of
attack, females release an aggregation pheromone component which, in
combination with host monoterpenes released from pitch tubes, is
attractive to conspecifics (Bedard et al. 1969). An antiaggregation
pheromone component is produced during latter stages of host
colonization by several pathways, and is thought to reduce intraspecific
competition by altering adult behavior to minimize overcrowding of
developing brood within the host (Byers and Wood 1980). Volatiles from
several nonhosts sympatric with ponderosa pine have been demonstrated to
inhibit attraction of WPB (Shepherd et al. 2007, Fettig and Hilszczański
2015). In California, the WPB can have 2-3 generations in a single year
and can often out-compete its congener, the mountain pine beetle,
\emph{Dendroctonus ponderosa} (MPB), for the ponderosa pine host
especially in larger trees (Miller and Keen 1960, Fettig 2016).

\subsubsection{Aerial data collection and
processing}\label{aerial-data-collection-and-processing}}

Nadir-facing imagery was captured using a gimbal-stabilized DJI Zenmuse
X3 broad-band red/green/blue (RGB) camera (DJI 2015a) and a
fixed-mounted Micasense Rededge3 multispectral camera with five narrow
bands (Micasense 2015) on a DJI Matrice 100 aircraft (DJI 2015b).
Imagery was captured from both cameras along preprogrammed aerial
transects over \textasciitilde{}40 hectares surrounding each of the 36
sites (each of these containing five field plots) and was processed in a
series of steps to yield local forest structure and composition data
suitable for our statistical analysis. Following the call by Wyngaard et
al. (2019), we establish ``data product levels'' to reflect the image
processing pipeline from raw imagery (Level 0) to calibrated, fine-scale
forest structure and composition information on regular grids (Level 4),
with each new data level derived from levels below it. Here, we outline
the steps in the processing and calibration pipeline visualized in
Figure 2, and include additional details in the Supplemental Methods.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=9in]{../../figures/drone-data-levels.png}

Figure 2. Schematic of the data processing workflow for a single site
with each new data product level derived from data at lower levels.

Level 0 represents raw data from the sensors. From left to right:
example broad-band RGB photo from DJI Zenmuse X3 camera, example blue
photo from Rededge3 (centered on 475nm), example green photo from
Rededge3 (centered on 560nm), example red photo from Rededge3 (centered
on 668nm), example near infrared photo from Rededge3 (centered on
840nm), and example red edge photo from Rededge3 (centered on 717nm).

Level 1 represents basic outputs from the photogrammetric workflow, in
this case implemented with Pix4Dmapper. From left to right: a dense
point cloud visualized in CloudCompare
(\url{https://www.danielgm.net/cc/}), an orthophoto generated from the
RGB camera, and a digital surface model representing the altitude above
sea level (ground height + vegetation height) for every cell.

Level 2 represents outputs from photogrammetric processing that have
been corrected radiometrically or geometrically. From left to right: a
radiometrically-corrected surface reflectance map of the red narrow band
from the Rededge3 camera, a radiometrically-corrected surface
reflectance map of the near infrared narrow band from the Rededge3
camera, a rasterized version of the digital terrain model derived by a
geometric correction of the dense point cloud, and a canopy height model
derived by subtracting the terrain height from the digital surface
model.

Level 3 represents domain-specific information extraction from Level 2
products and is divided into two sub-levels. Level 3a products are
derived using only spectral or only geometric data. From left to right:
a reflectance map of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; Rouse
et al. (1973)) derived using the red and near infrared Level 2
reflectance products, a map of points representing detected trees from
the canopy height model with a red polygon highlighting the area
presented in more detail for the next two images, a close-up of points
representing detected trees, and a close-up of polygons representing
segmented tree crowns. Level 3b products are derived using both spectral
and geometric data. From left to right: a map of the point locations of
detected trees that have been classified as alive or dead based on the
pixel values within each segmented tree crown and a map of the point
locations of detected trees classified to WPB host/non-host using the
same spectral information. Note that our study relies on the generation
of Level 3a products in order to combine them and create Level 3b
products, but this need not be the case. For instance, deep
learning/neural net methods may be able to use both the spectral and
geometric information from Level 2 simultaneously to locate and classify
trees in a scene and directly generate Level 3b products without a need
to first generate the Level 3a products shown in this schematic.

Level 4 represents aggregations of Level 3 products to regular grids
which might better reflect the grain size of the data for which we have
the best calibration and thus the most confidence or which might provide
new information not possible at an individual-tree level (e.g., average
distance between trees in a small neighborhood) From left to right:
aggregation of live/dead classified trees as fraction of dead trees in a
20 x 20-m cell and aggregation of host/non-host classified trees as
fraction of hosts in a 20 x 20-m cell. In our case, the 20 x 20-m
aggregation produces a grid cell with an area of
400m\textsuperscript{2}, which most closely matches the
404m\textsuperscript{2} area of the ground-based vegetation plots whose
data we used in an aggregated form to calibrate our derivation of Level
3 products.

\hypertarget{level-0-raw-data-from-sensors}{%
\subsubsection{Level 0: Raw data from
sensors}\label{level-0-raw-data-from-sensors}}

Raw data comprised approximately 1900 images per camera lens (one
broad-band RGB lens and five narrow-band multispectral lenses) for each
of the 32 sites (Figure 2; Level 0). Prior to the aerial survey, two
strips of bright orange drop cloth (\textasciitilde{}100 cm x 15 cm)
were positioned as an ``X'' over the permanent monuments marking the
center of the 5 field plots from Fettig et al. (2019) (see Supplemental
Figures).

We preprogrammed north-south aerial transects using Map Pilot for DJI on
iOS flight software (DronesMadeEasy 2018) at an altitude of 120 m above
ground level (with ``ground'' defined using a 1-arc-second digital
elevation model (Farr et al. 2007)). The resulting ground sampling
distance was approximately 5 cm/px for the Zenmuse X3 RGB camera and
approximately 8 cm/px for the Rededge3 multispectral camera. We used
91.6\% image overlap (both forward and side) at the ground for the
Zenmuse X3 RGB camera and 83.9\% overlap (forward and side) for the
Rededge3 multispectral camera.

\hypertarget{level-1-basic-outputs-from-photogrammetric-processing}{%
\subsubsection{Level 1: Basic outputs from photogrammetric
processing}\label{level-1-basic-outputs-from-photogrammetric-processing}}

We used structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry implemented in
Pix4Dmapper Cloud (www.pix4d.com) to generate dense point clouds (Figure
2; Level 1, left), orthophotos (Figure 2; Level 1, center), and digital
surface models (Figure 2; Level 1, right) for each field site (Frey et
al. 2018). For 29 sites, we processed the Rededge3 multispectral imagery
alone to generate these products. For three sites, we processed the RGB
and the multispectral imagery together to enhance the point density of
the dense point cloud. All SfM projects resulted in a single processing
``block,'' indicating that all images in the project were optimized and
processed together. The dense point cloud represents x, y, and z
coordinates as well as the color of millions of points per site. The
orthophoto represents a radiometrically uncalibrated, top-down view of
the survey site that preserves the relative x/y positions of objects in
the scene. The digital surface model is a rasterized version of the
dense point cloud that shows the altitude above sea level for each pixel
in the scene at the ground sampling distance of the camera that
generated the Level 0 data.

\paragraph{Radiometric corrections}\label{radiometric-corrections}}

A radiometrically-corrected reflectance map (Figure 2; Level 2, left two
figures; i.e., a corrected version of the Level 1 orthophoto) was
generated using the Pix4D software by incorporating incoming light
conditions for each narrow band of the Rededge3 camera (captured
simultaneously with the Rededge3 camera using an integrated downwelling
light sensor) as well as a pre-flight image of a calibration panel of
known reflectance (see Supplemental Methods for camera and calibration
panel details).

\hypertarget{geometric-corrections}{%
\paragraph{Geometric corrections}\label{geometric-corrections}}

We implemented a geometric correction to the Level 1 dense point cloud
and digital surface model by normalizing these data for the terrain
underneath the vegetation. We generated the digital terrain model
representing the ground underneath the vegetation at 1 meter resolution
(Figure 2; Level 2, third image) by classifying each survey area's dense
point cloud into ``ground'' and ``non-ground'' points using a cloth
simulation filter algorithm (Zhang et al. 2016) implemented in the
\texttt{lidR} (Roussel et al. 2019) package and rasterizing the ground
points using the \texttt{raster} package (Hijmans et al. 2019). We
generated a canopy height model (Figure 2; Level 2, fourth image) by
subtracting the digital terrain model from the digital surface model.

Using just the spectral information from the radiometrically-corrected
reflectance maps, we calculated several vegetation indices including the

Using just the geometric information from the canopy height model or
terrain-normalized dense point cloud, we generated maps of detected
trees (Figure 2; Level 3a, second and third images) by testing a total
of 7 automatic tree detection algorithms and a total of 177 parameter
sets (Table 1). We converted the height of each tree determined using
the Level 2 canopy height model to its diameter at breast height, 1.37m
(DBH). We used the field plot data to assess each tree detection
algorithm/parameter set by converting the distance-from-center and
azimuth measurements of the trees in the field plots to x-y positions
relative to the field plot centers distinguishable in the Level 2
reflectance maps as the orange fabric X's that we laid out prior to each
flight. In the reflectance maps, we located 110 out of 160 field plot
centers while some plot centers were obscured due to dense interlocking
tree crowns or because a plot center was located directly under a single
tree crown. For each of the 110 field plots with identifiable plot
centers-- the ``validation field plots'', we calculated 7 forest
structure metrics using the ground data collected by Fettig et al.
(2019): total number of trees, number of trees greater than 15 meters,
mean height of trees, 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile tree height,
75\textsuperscript{th} percentile tree height, mean distance to nearest
tree neighbor, and mean distance to second nearest neighbor. For each
tree detection algorithm and parameter set described above, we
calculated the same set of 7 structure metrics within the footprint of
the validation field plots. We calculated the Pearson's correlation and
root mean square error (RMSE) between the ground data and the aerial
data for each of the 7 structure metrics for each of the 177 automatic
tree detection algorithms/parameter sets. For each algorithm and
parameter set, we calculated its performance relative to other
algorithms as whether its Pearson's correlation was within 5\% of the
highest Pearson's correlation as well as whether its RMSE was within 5\%
of the lowest RMSE. We summed the number of forest structure metrics for
which it reached these 5\% thresholds for each algorithm/parameter set.
For automatically detecting trees across the whole study, we selected
the algorithm/parameter set that performed well across the most number
of forest metrics (see Results).

We delineated individual tree crowns (Figure 2; Level 3a, fourth image)
with a marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm (Meyer and
Beucher 1990) implemented in the \texttt{ForestTools} package (Plowright
2018) using the detected treetops as markers. If the automatic
segmentation algorithm failed to generate a crown segment for a detected
tree (e.g., often snags with a very small crown footprint), a circular
crown was generated with a radius of 0.5 meters. If the segmentation
generated multiple polygons for a single detected tree, only the polygon
containing the detected tree was retained. Because image overlap
decreases near the edges of the overall flight path and reduces the
quality of the SfM processing in those areas, we excluded segmented
crowns within 35 m of the edge of the survey area. Given the narrower
field of view of the Rededge3 multispectral camera versus the X3 RGB
camera whose optical parameters were used to define the
\textasciitilde{}40 hectare survey area around each site, as well as the
35 m additional buffering, the survey area at each site was
\textasciitilde{}30 ha (see Supplemental Methods).

\paragraph{Level 3b: Data derived from spectral AND geometric
information}\label{level-3b-data-derived-from-spectral-and-geometric-information}}

We overlaid the segmented crowns on the reflectance maps from 20 sites
spanning the latitudinal and elevation gradient in the study. Using QGIS
(\url{https://qgis.org/en/site/}), we hand classified 564 trees as
live/dead (Figure 3) and as one of 5 dominant species in the study area
(\emph{Pinus ponderosa}, \emph{Pinus lambertiana}, \emph{Abies
concolor}, \emph{Calocedrus decurrens}, or \emph{Quercus kelloggi})
using the mapped ground data as a guide. Each tree was further
classified as ``host'' for ponderosa pine or ``non-host'' for all other
species (Fettig 2016). We extracted all the pixel values within each
segmented crown polygon from the five, Level 2 orthorectified
reflectance maps (one per narrow band on the Rededge3 camera) as well as
from the five, Level 3a vegetation index maps using the \texttt{velox}
package (Hunziker 2017). For each crown polygon, we calculated the mean
value of the extracted Level 2 and Level 3a pixels and used them as ten
independent variables in a five-fold cross validated boosted logistic
regression model to predict whether the hand classified trees were alive
or dead. For just the living trees, we similarly used all 10 mean
reflectance values per crown polygon to predict tree species using a
five-fold cross validated regularized discriminant analysis. The boosted
logistic regression and regularized discriminant analysis were
implemented using the \texttt{caret} package in R (Kuhn 2008). Finally,
we used these models to classify all tree crowns in the data set as
alive or dead (Figure 2; Level 3b, first image) as well as the species
of living trees (Figure 2; Level 3b, second image).

Using the tree height and DBH field data from Fettig et al. (2019), we
fit a simple linear regression to predict DBH from height for each of
the five dominant species in the study area. We used these
species-specific allometric relationships between field-measured tree
height and DBH to estimate the DBH of each model-classified tree given
its species and height.

\hypertarget{level-4-aggregations-to-regular-grids}{%
\subsubsection{Level 4: Aggregations to regular
grids}\label{level-4-aggregations-to-regular-grids}}

We rasterized the forest structure and composition data at a spatial
resolution similar to that of the field plots to better match the grain
size at which we validated the automatic tree detection algorithms. In
each raster cell, we calculated: number of live trees, number of dead
trees, number of ponderosa pine trees, total number of trees (of all
species, including ponderosa pine). From these values, we calculated the
fraction of dead trees per cell (Figure 2; Level 4, first image) and the
fraction of host trees per cell (Figure 2; Level 4, second image). We
converted the count of ponderosa pine trees and the total tree count to
a density measurement of trees per hectare (tpha) by multiplying the
counts in each 20 x 20-m cell by 25 to create a ``host density'' and an
``overall density'' variable per cell. Finally, we then calculated a
separate quadratic mean diameter (QMD) for ponderosa pine and all trees
of any species for each 20 x 20-m cell as the square root of the average
squared diameter of trees (ponderosa or all) within the cell.

\hypertarget{note-on-assumptions-about-dead-trees}{%
\subsubsection{Note on assumptions about dead
trees}\label{note-on-assumptions-about-dead-trees}}

For the purposes of this study, we assumed that all dead trees were
ponderosa pine and thus hosts colonized by WPB. This is a reasonably
good assumption for our study area; for example, Fettig et al. (2019)
found that 73.4\% of dead trees in their coincident field plots were
ponderosa pine. Mortality was concentrated in the larger-diameter
classes and attributed primarily to WPB (see Fettig et al. (2019),
Figure 5). The species contributing to the next highest proportion of
dead trees was incense cedar which represented 18.72\% of the dead trees
in the field plots. While the detected mortality is most liklye to be
ponderosa pine, it is critical to interpret our results with this known
limitation in mind.

\hypertarget{environmental-data}{%
\subsubsection{Environmental data}\label{environmental-data}}

We used climatic water deficit (CWD) (Stephenson 1998) from the
1981-2010 mean value of the basin characterization model (Flint et al.
2013) as an integrated measure of temperature and moisture conditions
for each of the 32 sites. Higher values of CWD correspond to hotter,
drier conditions and lower values correspond to cooler, wetter
conditions. CWD has been shown to correlate well with broad patterns of
tree mortality in the Sierra Nevada (Young et al. 2017) as well as bark
beetle-induced tree mortality (Millar et al. 2012). We converted the CWD
value for each site into a z-score representing that site's deviation
from the mean CWD across the climatic range of Sierra Nevada ponderosa
pine as determined from 179 herbarium records described in Baldwin et
al. (2017). Thus, a CWD z-score of 1 would indicate that the CWD at that
site is one standard deviation hotter/drier than the mean CWD across all
geolocated herbarium records for ponderosa pine in the Sierra Nevada.

\hypertarget{statistical-model}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical model}\label{statistical-model}}

We used a generalized linear model with a zero-inflated binomial
response and a logit link to predict the probability of ponderosa pine
mortality within each 20 x 20-m cell as a function of the crossed
effects of ponderosa pine QMD and density added to the crossed effect of
QMD and density of trees of all species in each cell (hereafter
``overall QMD'' and ``overall density''), as well as the interaction of
each summand with climatic water deficit at each site.

To measure and account for spatial autocorrelation of the bark beetle
behavioral processes underlying ponderosa pine mortality, we subsampled
the data at each site to a random selection of 200, 20 x 20-m cells
representing approximately 27.5\% of the surveyed area. Additionally
with these subsampled data, we included a separate exact Gaussian
process term per site of the interaction between the x- and y-position
of each cell using the \texttt{gp()} function in the \texttt{brms}
package (Bürkner 2017). The Gaussian process estimates the spatial
covariance in the response variable (log-odds of ponderosa pine
mortality) jointly with the effects of the other covariates.

\[
\begin{aligned}
y_{i,j} \sim &\ \begin{cases}
0, & p \\
Binom(n_i, \pi_i), & 1-p
\end{cases} \\
logit(\pi_i) = &\ \beta_0\ + \\

& \mathcal{GP}_j(x_i, y_i) \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Where \(y_i\) is the number of dead trees in cell \(i\), \(n_i\) is the
sum of the dead trees (assumed to be ponderosa pine) and live ponderosa
pine trees in cell \(i\), \(\pi_i\) is the probability of ponderosa pine
tree mortality in cell \(i\), \(p\) is the probability of there being
zero dead trees in a cell arising as a result of an unmodeled process,
\(X_{cwd, j}\) is the z-score of climatic water deficit for site \(j\),
\(X_{pipoQMD, i}\) is the scaled quadratic mean diameter of ponderosa
pine in cell \(i\), \(X_{pipoDensity, i}\) is the scaled density of
ponderosa pine trees in cell \(i\), \(X_{overallQMD, i}\) is the scaled
quadratic mean diameter of all trees in cell \(i\),
\(X_{overallDensity, i}\) is the scaled density of all trees in cell
\(i\), \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are the x- and y- coordinates of the centroid
of the cell in an EPSG3310 coordinate reference system, and
\(\mathcal{GP}_j\) represents the exact Gaussian process describing the
spatial covariance between cells at site \(j\).

We used 4 chains with 2000 iterations each (1000 warmup, 1000 samples),
and confirmed chain convergence by ensuring all \texttt{Rhat} values
were less than 1.1 (Brooks and Gelman 1998). We used posterior
predictive checks to visually confirm model performance by overlaying
the density curves of the predicted number of dead trees per cell over
the observed number (Gabry et al. 2019). For the posterior predictive
checks, we used 50 random samples from the model fit to generate 50
density curves and ensured curves were centered on the observed
distribution, paying special attention to model performance at capturing
counts of zero.

We detected a small, generally positive main effect of climatic water
deficit on the probability of ponderosa pine mortality within each 20 x
20-m cell (Figure 4).

We found a strongly positive main effect of ponderosa pine local
density, with greater density increasing the probability of ponderosa
pine mortality. Conversely, we found a strong negative effect of overall
tree density (i.e., including both ponderosa pine and non-host species)
such that additional non-host trees in a 20 x 20-m cell (for the same
number of host trees) would decrease the probability of ponderosa pine
mortality (Figure 4).

We found a generally negative effect of quadratic mean diameter (QMD) of
ponderosa pine on the probability of ponderosa mortality, suggesting
that the western pine beetle attacked smaller trees, on average. There
was a strong positive interaction between the climatic water deficit and
ponderosa pine QMD, such that larger trees were more likely to increase
the probability of ponderosa mortality in hotter, drier sites (Figure
5).

There was a positive interaction between overall tree density and
overall QMD, such that denser stands with larger trees led to greater
ponderosa pine mortality, though the main effects of each of these
variables were weakly negative (Figure 4).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

This study represents a novel use of drones to further our understanding
of the simultaneous effects of local forest structure and composition
with broad-scale environmental gradients on tree mortality attributed to
WPB. We found strong positive effects (effect sizes \textgreater{}0.5)
of both host tree density and the interaction between site climatic
water deficit (CWD) and host tree mean size (QMD) on the probability of
ponderosa pine mortality. Conversely, we found a strong negative effect
(effect size \textless{}-0.5) of overall tree density. Surprisingly,
site CWD exerted only a weakly positive main effect on the probability
of ponderosa mortality (effect size: 0.07; 95\% CI: {[}-0.07, 0.20{]}).
To that end, we did not measure tree water stress at an individual tree
level as in other recent work (Stephenson et al. 2019), and instead
treated CWD as a general indicator of tree stress following results of
coarser-scale studies (Asner et al. 2016, Young et al. 2017). This may
have contributed to our failure to detect a stronger CWD effect. Also,
our entire study area experienced the same extreme hot drought between
2012 and 2015 and the variation of mortality explained by a main effect
of climatic water deficit may be dampened when most trees are
experiencing a high degree of water stress (Floyd et al. 2009, Fettig et
al. 2019).

\hypertarget{positive-effect-of-host-density-and-a-negative-effect-of-overall-density}{%
\subsubsection{Positive effect of host density and a negative effect of
overall
density}\label{positive-effect-of-host-density-and-a-negative-effect-of-overall-density}}

The strongest effect on the probability of ponderosa pine mortality was
the positive effect of local host density within each 20 x 20-m cell
(effect size: 0.91; 95\% CI: {[}0.82, 1.00{]}). The relationship between
host density and susceptibility to colonization by bark beetles has been
so well-documented at the experimental plot level (e.g., Raffa and
Berryman (1987), Oliver (1995)) that lowering stand densities through
selective harvest of hosts is commonly recommended for reducing future
levels of tree mortality attributed to bark beetles (Fettig and
Hilszczański 2015), including WPB (Fettig 2016). Greater host density
shortens the flight distance required for WPB to disperse to new host,
which likely facilitates bark beetle spread, but we calibrated our
aerial tree detection to \textasciitilde{}400 m\textsuperscript{2} areas
rather than to individual tree locations so don't have the data
precision to address this hypothesis directly. Increased density of
ponderosa pine, specifically, may disproportionately increase the
competitive environment for these WPB host trees (and thus increase
their susceptibility to WPB colonization) if intraspecific competition
amongst ponderosa pine trees is stronger than interspecfic competition
as would be predicted with coexistence theory (Chesson 2000). Finally,
greater host density likely increases the frequency that WPB land on
their preferred host and avoid expending energy flying to non-hosts.

Because we also found a strong negative effect of overall tree density
(host and non-host) within each cell while accounting for host density
(effect size: -0.80; 95\% CI: {[}-0.89, -0.71{]}), we suspect that the
positive association between host density and host mortality is at least
partially driven by mechanisms associated with the relative abundance of
species in a local area. That is, increasing overall tree density while
keeping host tree density constant (as would be the scenario to
interpret the marginal negative effect of overall tree density) implies
an increasing proportion of non-host trees. Frequency-dependent
herbivory--whereby mixed-species forests experience less herbivory
compared to monocultures-- is common, especially for oligophagous insect
species (Jactel and Brockerhoff 2007). Furthermore, it has been
demonstrated that nonhost volatiles reduce attraction of several species
of bark beetles to their aggregation pheromones (Seybold et al. 2018),
including WPB (Fettig et al. 2005). To that end, combinations of nonhost
volatiles and an antiaggregation pheromone have been used successfully
to reduce levels of tree mortality attributed to WPB (e.g., Fettig et
al. (2012){]}). The negative relationship that we detected between
overall tree density and host mortality corroborates findings from
Fettig et al. (2019), though Fettig et al. (2019) didn't simultaneously
model the effect of host density. In general however, Hayes et al.
(2009) and Fettig et al. (2019) found that measures of host availability
explained less variation in mortality than measures of overall tree
density, but those conclusions were based on a response variable of
``total number of dead host trees,'' rather than the number of dead host
trees conditional on the total number of host trees as in our study
(i.e., a binomial response).

\subsubsection{Negative main effect of host tree mean size, but strong
postive interaction with site
CWD}\label{negative-main-effect-of-host-tree-mean-size-but-strong-postive-interaction-with-site-cwd}}

Counter to our expectations, we found an overall negative effect of host
tree mean size on the probability of host mortality (effect size: -0.30;
95\% CI: {[}-0.50, -0.10{]}). WPB exhibit a preference for trees 50.8 to
76.2 cm in diameter at breast height (Person 1928, 1931), and a positive
relationship between host tree size and levels of tree mortality
attributed to WPB was reported by Fettig et al. (2019) in the coincident
field plots as well as in other recent studies (Stephenson et al. 2019,
Pile et al. 2019). Indeed, Fettig et al. (2019) reported no mortality in
ponderosa pine trees \textless{} 10.0 cm dbh. Larger trees are more
nutritious and are therefore ideal targets if local bark beetle density
is high enough to successfully initiate mass attack as can occur when
many trees are under severe water stress (Bentz et al. 2010). In the
recent hot drought, we expected that most trees would be under severe
water stress, setting the stage for increasing beetle density,
successful mass attacks, and targeting of larger trees. One possible
explanation for our finding is that our observations represent the
cumulative mortality of trees during a multi-year drought event and its
aftermath. Lower host tree mean size led to a greater probability of
host mortality earlier in the drought (Pile et al. 2019) and that signal
might have persisted even as mortality continued to accumulate driven by
other factors. Furthermore, Fettig et al. (2019) found no relationship
between tree size and tree mortality for incense cedar or white fir in
the coincident field plots. These species represent 22.3\% of the total
tree mortality observed in their study, yet in our study all dead trees
were classified as ponderosa pine (see Methods).

We did observe a strong host tree size effect in its interaction with
site CWD (effect size: 0.72; 95\% CI: {[}0.37, 1.07{]}). In hot, dry
sites, larger average host size increased the probability of host
mortality while smaller host sizes increased the probability of host
mortality in cool, wet sites. This suggests that the same bark beetle
species was cueing into different aspects of forest structure across the
environmental gradient. This represents an intraspecific version of the
results of Stephenson et al. (2019), who found that insect-induced tree
mortality in the same region during the same hot drought were driven by
different factors for different tree species. For instance, Stephenson
et al. (2019) found that ponderosa pine mortality was largely driven by
host selection behavior of forest insects, where larger more nutritious
trees were specifically targeted regardless of whether they exhibited
signs of stress. In contrast, Stephenson et al. (2019) found that white
fir mortality occurred predominantly in the slower growing, smaller,
stressed trees. In our study, we found that, even within a single
pairing of forest insect species and its host, the host tree size
affected host mortality differently depending on the site-level climatic
water deficit.

Despite high local levels of tree mortality across our study area
(Fettig et al. 2019), our results from surveying the broader context
surrounding coincident field plots reveals different effects of host
tree size depending on CWD, and perhaps different stages of bark beetle
disturbance across the environmental gradient. For primary bark beetles,
massive tree mortality as observed from the 2012-2015 drought and its
aftermath does not necessarily distinguish ``endemic'' from ``outbreak''
phases of bark beetle disturbance, which is instead distinguished by the
underlying driver of bark beetle host selection behavior (Logan et al.
1998). ``Endemic'' phases are distinguished by environmental
determinism, when beetles select hosts based on whether they are
weakened in some way, often by environmental conditions. ``Outbreak''
phases are distinguished by dynamic determinism, when population
dynamics reign-- when local beetle density is high enough that
intraspecific pheromone communication dominates host selection,
successful mass attacks are likely, and even large healthy trees can be
killed (White and Powell 1997, Logan et al. 1998). Different outbreak
cycle phases may help explain the especially high host mortality in high
host density, low host size cells that we observed in cool/wet sites
(Figure 5). The smaller trees would presumably be nutritionally
sub-optimal, and thus unexpected targets if the WPB were indeed in an
``outbreak'' phase at these sites and able to attack even large, healthy
trees. While trees were likely water stressed across the whole study due
to the extreme drought, we expected generally less water stress in the
cool/wet sites, and generally higher water stress in the hot/dry sites
(Asner et al. 2016, Young et al. 2017). Thus, it is possible that the
observed mortality patterns across the Sierra Nevada during the
2012-2015 hot drought arose as synergistic alignment of environmental
conditions and complex forest structure enabled the WPB to cross
thresholds of ``outbreak'' behavior in the hottest, driest sites but
such an alignment was not present in the cooler, wetter sites (Raffa et
al. 2008).

\hypertarget{limitations-and-future-directions}{%
\subsection{Limitations and future
directions}\label{limitations-and-future-directions}}

We have demonstrated that drones can be effective means of collecting
forest data at multiple, vastly different spatial scales to investigate
a single, multi-scale phenomenon-- from meters in between trees, to
hundreds of meters of elevation, to hundreds of thousands of meters of
latitude. Some limitations remain but can be overcome with further
refinements in the use of this tool for forest ecology. Most of these
limitations arise from tree detection and classification uncertainty,
and thus it was imperative to work with field data for calibration and
uncertainty reporting.

The greatest limitation in our study arising from classification
uncertainty is in the assumption that all dead trees were ponderosa
pine. While spectral information of foliage could help classify living
trees to species, standing dead trees did not reflect differently for
different species. We estimate from coincident field plots that this is
true approximately 73.4\% of the time. Because tree mortality response
to forest insects is species-specific, even with sympatric tree species
during the same hot drought (Stephenson et al. 2019), we cannot entirely
rule out that some of the mortality responses to complex forest
structure that we observed arose from these species-specific responses.
The overall community composition across our study area was not very
different (Fettig et al. 2019), so we remain confident that the patterns
we observed were driven primarily by the dynamic between the western
pine beetle and ponderosa pine. This challenge of classifying standing
dead trees to species implies that a conifer forest system with less
bark beetle and tree host diversity, such as mountain pine
beetle-induced mortality in monocultures of lodgepole pine, should be
particularly amenable to the methods presented here even with minimal
further refinement because a dead tree will almost certainly belong to a
single species and have succumbed due to bark beetle colonization.

Some uncertainty surrounded our ability to detect trees using the
geometry of the dense point clouds derived with SfM. The horizontal
accuracy of the tree detection was better than the vertical accuracy,
which may result from a more significant error contribution by the
field-based calculations of tree height compared to tree position
relative to plot center (Table 2). Both the horizontal and vertical
accuracy would likely improve with better SfM point clouds, which
requires imagery with more overlap. Frey et al. (2018) recently found
that 95\% overlap was preferable for generating dense point clouds, and
we only achieved 91.6\% overlap with the X3 RGB camera and 83.9\%
overlap with the multispectral camera. While our live/dead
classification was fairly accurate (97.3\% on a withheld dataset), our
species classifier would likely benefit from better crown segmentation
because the pixel-level reflectance values within each crown are
averaged to characterize the ``spectral signature'' of each tree. With
better delineation of each tree crown, the mean value of pixels within
each tree crown will likely be more representative of that tree's
spectral signature. Better crown segmentation would most readily be
achieved through greater overlap in imagery. Finally, we anticipate that
computer vision and deep learning will prove helpful in overcoming some
of these detection and classification challenges (Gray et al. 2019).

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

Climate change adaptation strategies emphasize reducing tree densities
to restore forest resilience (North et al. 2015, Young et al. 2017), but
understanding the optimal complex forest structure that can enable dry
western U.S. forests to persist through disturbances such as insect
attack will be vital for predicting how California forests may respond
to these interventions. We've shown that drones can be a valuable tool
for investigating how this complexity in forest structure combines with
environmental conditions to shape forest insect disturbance.

Our results support conclusions of other researchers that management
interventions to reduce the severity of bark beetle disturbance will
benefit from generally reducing host density (Young et al. 2017). In
addition however, our study suggests that outcomes will depend on
whether the disturbance dynamic has crossed endemic to outbreak feedback
thresholds (Raffa et al. 2008), which may be predicted by recent
advances in disturbance forecasting (Preisler et al. 2017).
