# This script will create small, cropped rasters of the Pix4D orthophoto outputs that overlap the plots (where the orange X's over the plot centers were visible)
# By saving the much smaller rasters as separte files, they will be much faster to work with and test different crown segmentation methods on the in situ data.
# Before chopping up the original orthophoto, each raster (of the 40ha area; ~625m x 625m) is ~600MB, but we only use between 1 and 5, ~25m x 25m sections of the orthophoto that overlap the ground plots. Performing multiple tree top detection and crown segmentation algorithms on the 144 plots with known coordinates in the orthophoto (because their orange X's were visible in the orthophoto) will be much faster using the smaller rasters.
