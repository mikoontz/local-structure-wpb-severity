# The merged versus the unmerged sites will have different numbers of bands
# Because the merged sites will have the X3 imagery incorporated, there will
# be an extra 3 bands for the ortho and the index outputs (the R, G, and B
# from the X3 camera)
# The R, G, and B bands from the X3 images will always be the final three bands
# if they exist.
# For the RedEdge-derived products, the bands go in the order of wavelength,
# from shortest to longest (B, G, R, RE, NIR)
# There is one Pix4D derived index (NDVI), which will go after the NIR band
# for the index mosaic

# This is where I can put in sites that need their processing redone. An empty 
# string means that no already-processed site output will be overwritten
# (but sites that have yet to be processed will still have their processing done)
