The "plot-locations" shapefile was generated by opening up the Pix4D generated RGB orthomosaic, 
overlaying the GPS points used for navigating to the permanent plots in the field, and searching nearby
for the orange "X" ground control point laid out exactly at each plot center. The distance and azumith 
from theses plot centers will be used for validating the aerial imagery with the on-the-ground tree
measurements.
