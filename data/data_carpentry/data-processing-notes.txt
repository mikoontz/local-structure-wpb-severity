Data processing notes for local-structure-wpb-severity project

Note that the following sites were processed with a less intensive Step 2 Densified point cloud operation in pix4d:

sequ_4k_1
sequ_4k_2
sequ_5k_3
sier_4k_1
stan_3k_1

The result is a far less dense point cloud, which has as-of-yet unknown consequences for crown segmentation

All of these sites were reprocessed using the same Step 2 Densified point cloud as the others 
(1/2 image scale; multiscale-- instead of 1/4 image scale; multiscale)

sier_4k_3 has some red stage trees, which might be good for training the logistic regression
