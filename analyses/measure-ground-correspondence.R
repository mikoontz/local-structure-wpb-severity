# Pseudocode
# Calculate the "validation metrics" for the ground data at the plots that are visible in the drone-derived orthophotos
#
# (Explanation: we define "validation metrics" to be things that we care about in the forest
# By picking 2+ "validation metrics" that are somewhat non-correlated and then matching them to the same metrics calculated
# using the treetop detection/crown segmentation algorithm, we can compare the quality of different algorithms.
# The greater the combined correlation of the "validation metrics" between algorithm-derived metrics and ground data-derived
# metrics, the better the algorithm.)
#
# Candidate "validation metrics" include:
# tree density within a plot
# live tree density
# dead tree density
# tree size distribution within a plot (25th and 75th percentile height; mean height)
# proportion of live trees
# Voronoi polygon areas might not work due to edge effects, but let's try mean distance to 3 nearest trees

# Establish a method for detecting tree tops and segmenting crowns
# Work through all of the remotely-visible plots at each site (144 in total) applying the ttops and crown segmentation approach

# These sites had X3 and RedEdge photos merged into the same project, so we look in a different place for some of the relevant
# files.

  # Using the approach developed by Li et al. (2012)
  # Using values from Shin et al. (2018) Remote Sensing.
  # "The segmentation method relies on four user-defined parameters: minimum height of a tree, 
  # maximum crown radius, and two numeric distances, which define horizontal distance (in meters) 
  # thresholds between all points above 15 m in height, and below 15 m in height. These 
  # thresholds values are hereafter referred to as distance thresholds (DT). The DT value is site 
  # specific [42]. A low DT value generally results in over-segmentation with many additional 
  # trees identified in the point cloud, whereas a high DT value causes under-segmentation, where 
  # many tree canopies are merged together into single large canopies. In this study, 16 different 
  # iterations of varying DT values were tested. We used a minimum tree height of 2 m, and a 
  # maximum canopy diameter of 7 m, based on the ranges observed in our field data."
  
  # "The parameters used in a given tree segmentation algorithm must be “tuned” to match the 
  # specific site and user’s needs. We used a point-based algorithm [42] to segment individual 
  # trees from the point cloud. The main parameter that affected the segmentation was the DT 
  # parameter—a distance threshold between points that determined whether a point was or was not 
  # part of a particular tree. Within the Li et al. [42] segmentation algorithm, there are two 
  # different DT values, both of which were set as equal in our study. In future studies, these 
  # values can be set differently to potentially achieve better segmentation results."
  # "The optimized iteration contains two DT values: 1.4 m for areas with more than 50% canopy 
  # cover, and 1.7 m for areas of 50% or less canopy cover."
  
  # Could systematically iterate through many parameter combinations...
